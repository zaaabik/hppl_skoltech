**Question:** Measure the timing, can you explain the difference between speed of FFT for different sample size? Write something as a possible explanation. (2 points)

**Answer:**
The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) can achi–ªeve the best 
performance using a divide-and-conquer approach when you 
split the sequence into two parts and apply the algorithm to each part. 
If your sequence has a length that is a power of 2, you can efficiently split this sequence into two parts until the sequence length is reduced to 1
